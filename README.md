<a href="http://bookdem.com/github/index3.php">DEMO</a> 

This prject allows you to implement a login with facebook button that retrieves user information from to Facebook api to be display on the member page. It also stores the data gathered from facebook to a mySQL database. 

To set up: 

1. Download the facebook SDK from developers.facebook.com and create a facebook app if you dont have one.
2. Copy your app id and secret to the required fields in teh files. 
2. Create a database with prefered content. 
3. Sync it with the files inputing your database access information inside login2.php and register2.php. 
4. Thats it! Enjoy! 


This is by no means a final project and is still in the works of getting improvement. Feel free to comment with any questions.
